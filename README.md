# Final Project - Add a Feature to FAQ

##Implement Search Functionality 

- The search bar feature will be able to fetch data from the database
- Then display the search results in a table
- The data: Users First Name + Last Name
---

- When the app runs locally, it is able to produce the Users First Name + Last Name
- Unfortunately, when the app is hosted on Heroku, Heroku does not acknowledge the database and can't properly display the data
